Real-world data can be disorderly and unclean, making analyses difficult. In this project, I have collected tweet data and details for the twitter archive of the user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs rates dogs with some humorous content about them. The ratings are out of 10, but these fun dogs all manage to score above 10. Since the twitter data consists primarily of tweets, additional data including favorite/retweet count data, and image predictions to identify dog breeds, were collected by querying Twitter's API and from alternate sources. These data were gathered, wrangled and analyzed in Python using the associated modules including numpy, pandas, matplotlib, requests, json and Tweepy.
